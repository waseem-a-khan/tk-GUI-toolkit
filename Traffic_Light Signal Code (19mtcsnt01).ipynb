    "\"Traffic lights (or traffic signals) are lights used to control the movement of traffic. They are placed on roads at intersections and crossings. The different colors of lights tell drivers what to do\". It follow the one cycle for every crossing the cycle as follow:\n",

    "Red Light on: This tells drivers to stop\n",
    "Green Light on: This means the driver can start driving or keep driving.\n",
    "Yellow Light on: This tells drivers to stop when it is safe to, because the light is about to turn red.\n",
    "Traffic lights change their colors in the same order every time and we can see the image for this cycle.\n",
